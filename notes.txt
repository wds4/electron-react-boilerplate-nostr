electron-react-boilerplate-nostr
Purpose: to do a hello world of nostr in erb
Forked erb in github
clones to MBPro

made cosmetic changes: imported from my template electron-react-boilerplate-ipfs

following https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr-tools

npm install nostr-tools
added to home.js:
import { generatePrivateKey, getPublicKey } from 'nostr-tools'

Got polyfill error; this is how I fixed it:
Followed advice from:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64557638/how-to-polyfill-node-core-modules-in-webpack-5
and updated .erb/configs/webpack.config.base.ts by adding under resolve:
fallback: {
  "stream": false,
}
